## üîß Usage

To use the attachment flow in any component:

1. Import the required components:
```typescript
import { SuccessUploadPopup } from "@/components/ui/success-upload-popup"
import { useAttachments } from "@/hooks/use-attachments"
```

2. Add state management:
```typescript
const [showUploadPopup, setShowUploadPopup] = useState(false)
const [createdItemId, setCreatedItemId] = useState<string>("")
const [createdItemName, setCreatedItemName] = useState<string>("")
```

3. Modify your creation handler to trigger the popup:
```typescript
const response = await createItem.mutateAsync(itemData)
setCreatedItemId(response.id)
setCreatedItemName(response.name)
setShowUploadPopup(true)
```

4. Add the popup component to your JSX:
```typescript
<SuccessUploadPopup
  isOpen={showUploadPopup}
  onClose={handleUploadClose}
  entityId={createdItemId}
  entityType="your_entity_type"
  category="your_category"
  itemName={createdItemName}
  onUploadSuccess={handleUploadSuccess}
/>
```
