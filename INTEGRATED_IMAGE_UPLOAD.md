# Integrated Image Upload Implementation

## Overview

Instead of showing a popup after item creation, the image upload is now integrated directly into the forms. This provides a better user experience by allowing users to upload images in a single form submission.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Product Form Integration

**File**: `components/product-form.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `FileUpload` component directly in the form
- Added image upload state management
- Modified submit handler to upload image after product creation/update
- Removed popup-based upload flow

**Features**:
- Image upload field in the form
- Automatic upload after product creation
- Support for image replacement during editing
- Progress indication during upload

### 2. Catalog Form Integration

**File**: `components/catalogs.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `FileUpload` component for catalog banner images
- Added image upload state management
- Modified submit handler to handle image upload
- Removed popup-based upload flow

**Features**:
- Banner image upload field in the form
- Automatic upload after catalog creation
- Progress indication during upload

### 3. API Structure

**Upload Endpoint**: `POST /attachments/upload/image`

**Request Structure**:
```
POST /attachments/upload/image?tenantId=xxx&entityId=xxx&entityType=product&category=product_image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

[FormData with file only]
```

**Parameters**:
- `tenantId`: Company ID (query parameter)
- `entityId`: Product/Catalog ID (query parameter)
- `entityType`: Entity type (query parameter)
- `category`: Attachment category (query parameter)
- `file`: Image file (FormData body)

### 4. Delete Attachment API

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /attachments/{attachmentId}`

**Usage**: For replacing images during editing, the old image is deleted before uploading the new one.

## Form Flow

### Product Creation/Editing
1. User fills out product form including image selection
2. Form is submitted
3. Product is created/updated
4. If image is selected, it's automatically uploaded
5. Success message is shown

### Catalog Creation/Editing
1. User fills out catalog form including banner image selection
2. Form is submitted
3. Catalog is created/updated
4. If image is selected, it's automatically uploaded
